# Project-Codes
Shipment_Sorter: This was a project I did in my Python course in fall of 2017. The program sorts packages by its name, item ID, and price.
                 Other projects were worked on during this course, but this project was part of the final exam for the course.

TransFINAL: This was a project I worked on for my Heat Transfer course in summer of 2018. The MATLAB script calculates the transient heat 
            transfer through an industrial stove top and outputs a video showing the heat transfer of over time. If you open the script in 
            MATLAB and run it, the animation will appear on your screen, and run until the temperature is 95% of the steady state value.
            If you would like to see the full animation, or anything else from this project please let me know.

GlobalFemSystem: This a small part of my biggest MATLAB project to date; a comprehensive finite element analysis program. This was done 
                 during my FEA course in fall of 2019. This specific code assembles the global stiffness matrix of the FEA problem. This 
                 program opperates with multiple functions, if you would like to see the other functions please let me know.
